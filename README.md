# Benchmark-Clustering-Mixed-data-Dissimilarity-methods
The R code and results used to produce the results reported in the artificially simulated benchmarking 
thesis "Dissimilarity-based clustering for mixed-type data: comparing Gower`s weighting and encoding strategies".
All analyses were conducted in R 4.5.0 using the reproducible scripts. 

## Description of files
* `SimulationCodeThesis.R`: R code for the complete simulation design. It also contains helper function for methods and simulations.
* `thesis_simulation_results_with_metadata.rds`: file rds (~7.5 MB) containing all the simulation results with metadata, including parameters settings and performance metrics
